  <h2 align=center font=bold> 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air </h2>
  <p align=center> The 1957 Chevrolet is a car which was introduced by Chevrolet in September 1956 for the 1957 </p>
  <p align=center> model year. It was available in three series models: the upscale Bel Air, the mid-range </p>
  <p align=center> Two-Ten, and the One-Fifty. A two-door station wagon, the Nomad was produced as a Bel Air </p>
  <p align=center> model. An upscale trim option called the "Delray" was available for two-ten 2-door sedans. </p>
  <p align=center> It is a popular and sought after classic car. These vehicles are often restored to their </p>
  <p align=center> original condition and sometimes modified. The car's image has been frequently used in toys, </p>
  <p align=center> graphics, music, movies and television.The '57 Chevy, as it is often known, is an auto </p>
  <p align=center> icon.</p>

  <h2 align=center font=bold> 1952 Hudson </h2>
  <p align=center> The Hudson Hornet was a full-sized automobile which was produced by the Hudson Motor Car Company </p>
  <p align=center> of Detroit, Michigan, between 1951 and 1954 and then by American Motors Corporation (AMC) in Kenosha, Wisconsin, </p>
  <p align=center> and marketed under the Hudson brand between 1955 and 1957. The first-generation Hudson Hornets featured a </p>
  <p align=center> functional "step-down" design with dropped floorpan and a chassis with a lower center of gravity than contemporary </p>
  <p align=center> vehicles that helped the car handle well – a bonus for racing. The Hornet's lower and sleeker look was </p>
  <p align=center> accentuated by streamlined styling, sometimes called "ponton" styling. The car's "unique, low slung appearance </p>
  <p align=center> and silky handling earned Hudson an image that – for many buyers – eclipsed luxury marques like Cadillac." </p>

  <h2 align=center font=bold> 1951 Ford Country Squire </h2>
  <p align=center> The 1950 Ford model range included a station wagon which, at the time of its introduction, was marketed as part of </p>
  <p align=center> the top-line Custom Deluxe trim. In the following spring, Ford began promoting the wagon as the Country Squire, although that </p>
  <p align=center> name did not appear anywhere on the car. Along with the name change came the addition of a fold-down middle-row seat. </p>
  <p align=center> Following the rest of the Ford lineup, the Country Squire was available with a standard 226 cid inline six-cylinder engine as </p>
  <p align=center> or an optional V-8. The first generation Country Squire was the beginning of the end of the full "woodie". The whole body </p>
  <p align=center> was made of steel, unlike the Ford wagons up to 1948 that were all wood from the cowl back except for the rear fenders. Real </p>
  <p align=center> wood attached to the steel body on the doors, sides and tailgate of the 1949 thru 1951 models, and Ford did not offer a </p>
  <p align=center> woodless version. The interiors were all paneled in wood also. GM would later introduce a two-door station wagon in 1955 </p>
  <p align=center> called the Chevrolet Nomad and Pontiac Safari. </p>

  <h2 align=center font=bold> 1965 Ford Mustang </h2>
  <p align=center> The first-generation Ford Mustang was manufactured by Ford from March 1964 until 1973. The introduction of the Mustang created </p>
  <p align=center> a new class of automobile known as the pony car. The Mustang’s styling, with its long hood and short deck, proved wildly popular </p>
  <p align=center> and inspired a host of competition.It was initially introduced as a hardtop and convertible with the fastback version put on sale in August 1964. </p>
  <p align=center> At the time of its introduction, the Mustang, sharing its underpinnings with the Falcon, was slotted into a compact car segment. </p>

  <h2 align=center font=bold> 1949 Ford Crestline Victoria </h2>
  <p align=center> The 1949 Ford was an American automobile produced by Ford. It was the first all-new automobile design introduced by the Big</p>
  <p align=center>  Three after World War II, civilian production having been suspended during the war, and the 1946-1948 models from Ford, GM, and Chrysler </p>
  <p align=center>  being updates of their pre-war models. Popularly called the "Shoebox Ford" for its slab-sided, "ponton" design, the 1949 Ford is credited </p>
  <p align=center>  both with saving Ford and ushering in modern streamlined car design with changes such as integrated fenders and more . The design would </p>
  <p align=center>  continue through the 1951 model year. </p>
